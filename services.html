			<p>The number one most important thing is the song. Every single decision made throughout the entirety of the record making process must be made for the benefit of the song. My job as a producer is to help your song evoke an emotion from the listener which then lays the groundwork for an emotional connection being made. Allow me to use my years of experience in the studio to get the best out of you and your music and to guide you through the record making process. Most often I engineer the music that I produce.</p>
