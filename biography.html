			  	  <p>After graduating from audio school, Chris “cut his teeth” at Electric Lady Studios, of Jimi Hendrix fame. First as an intern, and then accepting an offer to work in the tech department under the watchful eye of master studio technician Roger Deller. It was at Electric Lady that Chris developed his studio etiquette in the presence of A-list clientele and was able to gain an in-depth understanding to the inner workings of a world-class recording facility. During this time, Chris was able to learn and pick up tips and tricks, not only from the staff engineers and visiting engineers / producers, but also from two of the studio’s permanent residents and their teams of assistants. Those two include legendary multi Grammy winning mix engineers Michael Brauer (Coldplay, John Mayer, The Rolling Stones) and Tom Elmhirst (Adele, Lady Gaga, David Bowie).</p>
			  <p>After Electric Lady, Chris earned a position at Downtown Studios where he furthered his audio engineering skills while working on some very cool projects. The most notable includes assisting Grammy winning and multi-platinum selling engineer Paul Falcone (Michael Jackson, Missy Elliott, Jay-Z) and producer/musician Rostam Batmanglij (Vampire Weekend) while working with Charli XCX on a song for the Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 1 soundtrack.</p>
		   <p>Finally, before taking a step back from working for commercial studios to focus on freelance endeavors, Chris accepted the chief engineer position at Water Music. Here, he got to engineer and assistant engineer loads of projects including working with three time Grammy winner and multi-platinum selling engineer and producer Warren Riker (The Fugees, Santana, Lauryn Hill) on a project for Whitesnake bassist Michael Devin, and on a handful of projects learning from and working with legendary indie producer, recording engineer, mix engineer and all around amazing guy, John Agnello (Sonic Youth, Kurt Vile, Dinosaur Jr). Some of these sessions with John included assisting him on the mixing and the overdubbing / partial recording of albums for Land of Talk and assisting him on the mixing of albums for The Smith Street Band and Kandle.</p>
		   <p>As a freelance recording engineer, producer and mixing / mastering engineer, Chris has helped independent artists, of all genres, bring to life their musical visions and further their careers in the process. A track that Chris mixed, mastered and added additional production on for hip hop artist Young Chizz received nationwide terrestrial radio play and peaked at #7 on the independent Mediabase Rhythmic charts. This got Young Chizz the attention of industry A&R giant Jean Nelson (Lil Wayne, G-Eazy, T.I.).</p>
			  <p>Today, Chris splits his time between America and Finland. You can find him exercising his expertise in record making by recording, producing, mixing or mastering music for clients, as well as consulting and creating educational audio engineering related content.</p>
